# ramen

In early 2020, I decided to get good at making ramen because I was craving it and restaurants were not an option. I went into this expecting to arrive at some kind of a recipe to make good ramen, but have instead discovered a whole universe of permutations and combinations. I do not have a recipe yet, but I've acquired a clearer picture of the general framework, and a good idea of each of the components get made.

This repo contains all the material I've gathered in my own journey of learning to make ramen. I've also added links to my notes where applicable. I foresee myself updating this list, and notes as I go along. My medium term goal is to get a couple of canonized recipes out of this exploration that I can write into my [ForkableRecipes](https://github.com/reckoner165/ForkableRecipes) repo.

I live tweeted my first 10 or so attempts at making ramen. They are all strung together in [this rather dense twitter thread](https://twitter.com/reckoner165/status/1234670034896605186?s=20)
